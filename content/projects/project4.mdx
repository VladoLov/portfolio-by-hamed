# Using GraphQL for Efficient Data Management

GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs that allows clients to request
only the data they need. This post discusses how to leverage GraphQL in your
applications for efficient data fetching.

## 1. Setting Up a GraphQL Server

To get started, you need to set up a GraphQL server. Here's a simple example
using Apollo Server:

```javascript
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server')

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello, world!'
  }
}

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers })
server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ğŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`)
})
```
