Dark mode has become increasingly popular among users, enhancing the browsing
experience, especially in low-light environments. This post will guide you
through implementing dark mode in your web applications.

## 1. Using CSS Variables

CSS variables make it easy to switch between light and dark themes. Hereâ€™s how
to define them:

```css
:root {
  --background-color: white;
  --text-color: black;
}

.dark-mode {
  --background-color: black;
  --text-color: white;
}
```
