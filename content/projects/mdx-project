React Server Components (RSC) enable server-side rendering of components, allowing for faster and more efficient web applications. This post dives into how they work and how you can leverage them in your projects.

React Server Components enable the execution of component logic on the server, providing significant performance improvements by offloading rendering tasks from the client.

For instance, here's a simple component example that gets rendered on the server:

```jsx
// Example of a server component
export default function ServerGreeting() {
  return <h1>Hello from the Server!</h1>;
}
