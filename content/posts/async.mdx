### `async`, `await`, `try`, and `catch` in JavaScript

These keywords are essential when working with **asynchronous code** in
JavaScript, particularly when you want to handle **Promises** in a more readable
way without using `.then()` and `.catch()`.

---

### 1. **`async` Function**

- A function defined with the `async` keyword will always **return a Promise**,
  regardless of what you explicitly return inside the function.
- The `async` keyword enables the use of `await` inside the function.

#### Example:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  return 'Hello World'
}

fetchData().then(result => console.log(result)) // "Hello World"
```

---

### 2. **`await` Keyword**

- The `await` keyword can be used only inside `async` functions.
- It **pauses the execution** of the async function until the Promise is
  resolved or rejected.
- It essentially unwraps the value of the Promise, allowing you to write
  synchronous-looking code for asynchronous actions.

#### Example:

```javascript
async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const data = await response.json() // Pauses here until the Promise resolves
  console.log(data)
}

getData()
```

---

### 3. **`try` and `catch`**

- `try` and `catch` blocks are used for **error handling**.
- You wrap your code inside a `try` block, and if an error occurs during
  execution, the `catch` block is executed.
- In the context of `async/await`, you use `try/catch` to handle errors from
  asynchronous code (like failed network requests).

#### Example:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok')
    }
    const data = await response.json()
    console.log(data)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error)
  }
}

fetchData()
```

### Combining `async`, `await`, `try`, and `catch`

When you want to handle promises, `async/await` simplifies the code, and using
`try/catch` helps catch errors both in synchronous and asynchronous code.

#### Example: Fetching Data with Error Handling

```javascript
async function getUserData(userId) {
  try {
    // Make an async call to fetch user data
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/user/${userId}`)
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Error fetching user with id ${userId}`)
    }

    const userData = await response.json()
    return userData
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors gracefully
    console.error('Error fetching user data:', error)
  }
}

getUserData(1) // Fetch data for user with ID 1
```

---

### Key Points:

- **`async`**: Marks a function as asynchronous, returning a Promise.
- **`await`**: Pauses the function until a Promise is resolved, and it works
  only inside an `async` function.
- **`try/catch`**: Used to handle errors in both synchronous and asynchronous
  code. When working with `await`, you wrap it in a `try/catch` to catch
  potential errors from promises.

This structure keeps your asynchronous code cleaner and easier to read while
providing built-in error handling.
